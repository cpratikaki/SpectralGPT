### Downstream Pixel Tasks Prediction
For the segmentation and change detection prediction program, we recommend using the provided `predict.py` file, which will save the visualization results. The only tasks you need to complete are loading the pre-trained model and the image file to ensure correct inference.

```shell
cd /downstream_predict/OCSD
python predict.py
```

```shell
cd /downstream_predict/SegMunich
python predict.py
```
